Greetings! I am Nikita Kalinin, a PhD student  in the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), fortunate to be under the supervision of <a href='https://ist.ac.at/en/research/lampert-group/'>Christoph Lampert</a>. I am exploring the intriguing field of Differential Privacy as part of my recent academic journey. I am particularly interested to the following topics:


<ul>
  <li>Data Adaptive Differential Privacy</li>
  <li>Differentially Private Federated Learning</li>
  <li>Differentially Private Parameter Estimation</li>
</ul>
